# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Alex Disdier

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [September 29, Saturday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1: September 29, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the skeleton of my tribute page project from the freeCodeCamp Curriculum. I passed all the test. I then started to style my page. 

**Thoughts:** The hardest was to find the person I should write about. Then I had to come up with a design. I chose to follow medium style. 

**Duration:** 1h48

2. Project on github - [Tribute page](https://alexdisdier.github.io/tribute/)

### R1D2: September 30, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I realized I forgot to add [meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag), which is crucial for responsive design. 

I added some some media queries and work on my css. 
I included some share buttons. 
The page is pretty much finished. I'm going to ask some feedbacks to friends, polish and move on to next project. 

**Thoughts:** It is hard to keep it around an hour. It doesn't feel sufficient time to make significant progress. Nevertheless, it pushes you to stay efficient, which is something I need to work on. 

**Duration:** 2h23

### R1D3: October 1, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the tribute freecodecamp project.

- corrected a padding issue in my footer
- added a favicon that I made on [figma](https://www.figma.com)
- updated the project on codepen to be the same one as github

I then started to build the structural HTML markup of the survey freecodecamp project. 

**Thoughts:** Excited to move on to the next project. I wish I had more time

### R1D4: October 2, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I finished to build the Survey page in order to pass the tests set up by freecodecamp. 

I researched a topic for my survey and came up with "finding out which European ironman is best suited for you". The idea behind this survey is to help me decide which one I'll attempt within the next two years. 

I started building a json file to list all the ironmans. 

**Thoughts:** The hardest was to find the idea behind my survey and to shape the questions for the survey. 

**Duration:** 1h42

### R1D5: October 3, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I was wasting too much time on this simple survey and I was turning the exercise into a web app. 

Therefore, I decided to step down. I listed a couple of ironman as an introduction of the form. Then, the user can add one by sending me an email using the form. 

**Thoughts:** I got side tracked by other life priorities which made me lose focus. Tomorrow, I will aim at styling the form. I plan on finishing this project by October 5th.

### R1D6: October 4, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the UX of my form and the design using bootstrap 4. I still need to apply the UX rule to the selection options which stipulate if no more than 6 options are applied, they need to be display inline. 

**Thoughts:** I feel better today as I'm changing my mind set. The goal is not to rush to the finish line and to build as many projects as possible; The goal is to polish my skills as a developer, so I should keep a pace I'm confortable with.

### R1D7: October 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I improved the form design and added a bootstrap form validation. I finished the survey form project.

I will probably come back to it to improve it further down the challenge but for now, I'm onto the next project from freecodecamp. 

I had some extra time so I started to set up the Product landing page project. Passed 8/16 tests

**Thoughts:** I wish I could code longer but I feel like my eyes are closing.

**Today's Progress**: I passed all the tests of Product landing page and I chose a topic. Two products will be presented, a BMW s1000 r and a ducati monster 1200s. I started to do some research on the design I will be using and gathering some photos from unsplash I could use.

### R1D9: October 7, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I decided to set up my design on figma and I embedded the iframe into my website so people can keep track of my progress. I'm almost done with the mobile version design of my product landing page. 

I also shifted my interest of the product to solely the BMW s1000r. 

I'm going for a minimalist and futuristic style design

**Thoughts:** Figma is so powerful and intuitive. Loving it

### R1D16: October 14, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I started the technical documentation page project from the freeCodeCamp Curriculum. Before jumping into coding, I wrote down the content of my documentation which will server for a guide to my [digital vcard](https://github.com/alexdisdier/vcard/tree/master/dist). 

I Then did some research on the style I want to use for the documentation page. 

I am interested in using system UI fonts to draw clearer lines between the content and user interface, with zero latency. The content will be system UI and the titles will be either Fira Sans (Mozilla brand typeface), San Francisco (Apple brand typeface) or Roboto (Google brand typeface). 

**Thoughts:** Even though this is not coding per se, it is an important phase that will save time down the line. 

**Duration:** 2h08

**Today's Progress**: I finished the technical documentation page. I submitted to freecodecamp a but between a smoothscroll script and their test suite script. 

I updated all my codepen so they will be identical with my github repositories. 

I used my existing [portfolio](https://onze.digital) to pass the last project of the Responsive Web Design certification. I uploaded only one page to codepen and tweaked the html and css to pass the test suite.  

I claimed my certification.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I've done a lot of work in a short time.

Basic Algorithm Scripting

### R1D21: October 19, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I completed all the basic algorithm scripting from FreeCodeCamp.

My plan is to build a web page for myself so I can refer to the exercises I'm going through in FreeCodeCamp. I will use the design I made for the technical documentation page. I found 2 code editors I could use:
-[codemirror](https://codemirror.net/)
-[Ace Editor](https://ace.c9.io/#nav=howto)

I had to look at the solutions in order to move on to the next challenge. 

I did understand the solution but I wish I came up with it after so many hours. I ended up to study more regular expressions. 

**Thoughts:** I feel frustrated and I will need to go over those challenges again in the future to see if I understood the solutions correctly.

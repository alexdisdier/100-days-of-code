The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [September 29, Saturday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1: September 29, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the skeleton of my tribute page project from the freeCodeCamp Curriculum. I passed all the test. I then started to style my page. 

**Thoughts:** The hardest was to find the person I should write about. Then I had to come up with a design. I chose to follow medium style. 

**Duration:** 1h48

2. Project on github - [Tribute page](https://alexdisdier.github.io/tribute/)

### R1D2: September 30, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I realized I forgot to add [meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag), which is crucial for responsive design. 

I added some some media queries and work on my css. 
I included some share buttons. 
The page is pretty much finished. I'm going to ask some feedbacks to friends, polish and move on to next project. 

**Thoughts:** It is hard to keep it around an hour. It doesn't feel sufficient time to make significant progress. Nevertheless, it pushes you to stay efficient, which is something I need to work on. 

**Duration:** 2h23

### R1D3: October 1, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the tribute freecodecamp project.

- corrected a padding issue in my footer
- added a favicon that I made on [figma](https://www.figma.com)
- updated the project on codepen to be the same one as github

I then started to build the structural HTML markup of the survey freecodecamp project. 

**Thoughts:** Excited to move on to the next project. I wish I had more time 

**Duration:** 1h08

### R1D4: October 2, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I finished to build the Survey page in order to pass the tests set up by freecodecamp. 

I researched a topic for my survey and came up with "finding out which European ironman is best suited for you". The idea behind this survey is to help me decide which one I'll attempt within the next two years. 

I started building a json file to list all the ironmans. 

**Thoughts:** The hardest was to find the idea behind my survey and to shape the questions for the survey. 

**Duration:** 1h42

### R1D5: October 3, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I was wasting too much time on this simple survey and I was turning the exercise into a web app. 

Therefore, I decided to step down. I listed a couple of ironman as an introduction of the form. Then, the user can add one by sending me an email using the form. 

**Thoughts:** I got side tracked by other life priorities which made me lose focus. Tomorrow, I will aim at styling the form. I plan on finishing this project by October 5th. 

**Duration:** 2h00

### R1D6: October 4, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the UX of my form and the design using bootstrap 4. I still need to apply the UX rule to the selection options which stipulate if no more than 6 options are applied, they need to be display inline. 

**Thoughts:** I feel better today as I'm changing my mind set. The goal is not to rush to the finish line and to build as many projects as possible; The goal is to polish my skills as a developer, so I should keep a pace I'm confortable with. 

**Duration:** 2h13

### R1D7: October 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I improved the form design and added a bootstrap form validation. I finished the survey form project.

I will probably come back to it to improve it further down the challenge but for now, I'm onto the next project from freecodecamp. 

I had some extra time so I started to set up the Product landing page project. Passed 8/16 tests

**Thoughts:** I wish I could code longer but I feel like my eyes are closing. 

**Duration:** 2h02

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

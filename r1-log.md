# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Alex Disdier

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [September 29, Saturday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1: September 29, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the skeleton of my tribute page project from the freeCodeCamp Curriculum. I passed all the test. I then started to style my page. 

**Thoughts:** The hardest was to find the person I should write about. Then I had to come up with a design. I chose to follow medium style. 

**Duration:** 1h48

2. Project on github - [Tribute page](https://alexdisdier.github.io/tribute/)

### R1D2: September 30, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I realized I forgot to add [meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag), which is crucial for responsive design. 

I added some some media queries and work on my css. 
I included some share buttons. 
The page is pretty much finished. I'm going to ask some feedbacks to friends, polish and move on to next project. 

**Thoughts:** It is hard to keep it around an hour. It doesn't feel sufficient time to make significant progress. Nevertheless, it pushes you to stay efficient, which is something I need to work on. 

**Duration:** 2h23

### R1D3: October 1, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the tribute freecodecamp project.

- corrected a padding issue in my footer
- added a favicon that I made on [figma](https://www.figma.com)
- updated the project on codepen to be the same one as github

I then started to build the structural HTML markup of the survey freecodecamp project. 

**Thoughts:** Excited to move on to the next project. I wish I had more time

### R1D4: October 2, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I finished to build the Survey page in order to pass the tests set up by freecodecamp. 

I researched a topic for my survey and came up with "finding out which European ironman is best suited for you". The idea behind this survey is to help me decide which one I'll attempt within the next two years. 

I started building a json file to list all the ironmans. 

**Thoughts:** The hardest was to find the idea behind my survey and to shape the questions for the survey. 

**Duration:** 1h42

### R1D5: October 3, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I was wasting too much time on this simple survey and I was turning the exercise into a web app. 

Therefore, I decided to step down. I listed a couple of ironman as an introduction of the form. Then, the user can add one by sending me an email using the form. 

**Thoughts:** I got side tracked by other life priorities which made me lose focus. Tomorrow, I will aim at styling the form. I plan on finishing this project by October 5th.

### R1D6: October 4, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the UX of my form and the design using bootstrap 4. I still need to apply the UX rule to the selection options which stipulate if no more than 6 options are applied, they need to be display inline. 

**Thoughts:** I feel better today as I'm changing my mind set. The goal is not to rush to the finish line and to build as many projects as possible; The goal is to polish my skills as a developer, so I should keep a pace I'm confortable with.

### R1D7: October 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I improved the form design and added a bootstrap form validation. I finished the survey form project.

I will probably come back to it to improve it further down the challenge but for now, I'm onto the next project from freecodecamp. 

I had some extra time so I started to set up the Product landing page project. Passed 8/16 tests

**Thoughts:** I wish I could code longer but I feel like my eyes are closing.

### R1D16: October 14, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I started the technical documentation page project from the freeCodeCamp Curriculum. Before jumping into coding, I wrote down the content of my documentation which will server for a guide to my [digital vcard](https://github.com/alexdisdier/vcard/tree/master/dist). 

I Then did some research on the style I want to use for the documentation page. 

I am interested in using system UI fonts to draw clearer lines between the content and user interface, with zero latency. The content will be system UI and the titles will be either Fira Sans (Mozilla brand typeface), San Francisco (Apple brand typeface) or Roboto (Google brand typeface). 

**Thoughts:** Even though this is not coding per se, it is an important phase that will save time down the line. 

**Duration:** 2h08

I updated all my codepen so they will be identical with my github repositories. 

I used my existing [portfolio](https://onze.digital) to pass the last project of the Responsive Web Design certification. I uploaded only one page to codepen and tweaked the html and css to pass the test suite.  

I claimed my certification.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I've done a lot of work in a short time.

I encountered a problem with CORS on the local server.

I also worked a bit on React today.

**Thoughts:** A pretty productive day

**Duration:** 4h

**Links to work:** 
On github - [Snap Pages](https://alexdisdier.github.io/snap-pages/)

### R1D49: November 16, 2018

**Thoughts:** React definitely has a learning curve. 

**Duration:** 2h56

### R1D52: November 19, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I started the Redux challenges. Redux is a state management framework that can be used with a number of different web technologies, including React.

The Redux store is the single source of truth when it comes to application state.

**Thoughts:** No real strenght today. 

**Duration:** 1h09

### R1D52: November 22, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Redux challenges and I started the React and Redux Challenges, 

I like how FreeCodeCamp summed up Redux and React: React is a view library that you provide with data, then it renders the view in an efficient, predictable way. Redux is a state management framework that you can use to simplify the management of your application's state.

**Thoughts:** Day travel with time changes means I missed 2 days. There were absolutely no time to code when travelling with the spouse and daughter. 

Sometimes, it's good to take a step back from coding and let the knowledge sink in. When you come back to it, you might be surprised how things became clearer and this will boost your confidence. 

**Duration:** 2h35

### R1D53: November 23, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I made some progress on the React and Redux Challenges and I'm close to move on to the Front End Libraries Projects.

I started to work on the Front End Libraries Projects "Build a Random Quote Machine". To build this project, I will use a mix of 
- HTML,
- JavaScript, 
- Bootstrap, 
- SASS, 
- React, 
- Redux

To speed up the set up of my working environment, I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) - An officially supported way to start a client-side React project with no configuration. 

```
npm init react-app my-app
```
or with Node 8.10.0 or later
```
npx create-react-app my-app
```

- I created the markup html for the project and created a github repo. 

On a separate note, I disabled the creation of .DS_Store file on mac which gets really annoying while set up your working environment. I used the following command and rebooted my mac. [source](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-disable-the-creation-of-dsstore-files-for-mac-users-folders/)

```
defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores true
```

In case you need to reenable it, use the following command in your terminal:
```
defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores false
```

**Thoughts:** Felt like I made some good progress today

### R1D56: November 25, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I carried on working on my random quote machine project.

- I wrote a simple README.md file to give me a guide line of my project
- I read about React.js architecture - [Better-organize-your-react-applications](https://medium.com/@alexmngn/how-to-better-organize-your-react-applications-2fd3ea1920f1) - [File structure](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html) - [react-architecture-best-practices](https://www.sitepoint.com/react-architecture-best-practices/)
- I read the [Create React App]() documentation. 
- I installed node-sass to use Sass
- I added the extension "React Developer Tools" on chrome (Allow access to file URLs in settings for a local file:// URL)
- I installed [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/basics/introduction/) - Storybook is a development environment for React UI components. It allows you to browse a component library, view the different states of each component, and interactively develop and test components.

**Thoughts:** Enjoy the setting up process and I didn't want to jump into code without having build a solid base.

### R1D65: December 4, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I spent quite sometime trying to pass data from one sibling to another in my React app. 

- I understood the only way was to go from child to parent and parent to sibling. (quite tedious)
- Read on [React component communication](https://www.javascriptstuff.com/component-communication/#5-parent-component).
- Carried on the Udemy React course.

### R1D66: December 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I figured out how to pass data from grandparent to grandchildren, parents to children and children to parents. React is basically a big family. 

- When powered on, the pad works. Otherwise audio remains on pause when clicked. 
- Also, the static display turns on on power. Next I have to dynamically display the pad name onto the display

**Thoughts:** spaghetti links is tough to wrap my head around.

### R1D74: December 13, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I reached 13 out of 16 tests passed on FFC for my calculator.

3 tests to go:
* in any order, I should be able to add, subtract, multiply and divide a chain of numbers of any length, and when I hit "=", the correct result should be shown in the element with the id of "display"
* When inputting numbers, my calculator should not allow a number to begin with multiple zeros.
* When the decimal element is clicked, a "." should append to the currently displayed value; two "." in one number should not be accepted

**Thoughts:** I made some great progress and my code is easier to understand.

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [September 29, Saturday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1: September 29, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the skeleton of my tribute page project from the freeCodeCamp Curriculum. I passed all the test. I then started to style my page. 

**Thoughts:** The hardest was to find the person I should write about. Then I had to come up with a design. I chose to follow medium style. 

**Duration:** 1h48

**Links to work:** 
1. Project on codepen - [Tribute page](https://codepen.io/alexdisdier/pen/XxWpZR)
2. Project on github - [Tribute page](https://alexdisdier.github.io/tribute/)

### R1D2: September 30, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I realized I forgot to add [meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag), which is crucial for responsive design. 

I added some some media queries and work on my css. 
I included some share buttons. 
The page is pretty much finished. I'm going to ask some feedbacks to friends, polish and move on to next project. 

**Thoughts:** It is hard to keep it around an hour. It doesn't feel sufficient time to make significant progress. Nevertheless, it pushes you to stay efficient, which is something I need to work on. 

**Duration:** 2h23

### R1D3: October 1, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the tribute freecodecamp project.

- corrected a padding issue in my footer
- added a favicon that I made on [figma](https://www.figma.com)
- updated the project on codepen to be the same one as github

I then started to build the structural HTML markup of the survey freecodecamp project. 

**Thoughts:** Excited to move on to the next project. I wish I had more time 

**Duration:** 1h08

4. On github - [Survey page](https://alexdisdier.github.io/survey/)

### R1D4: October 2, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I finished to build the Survey page in order to pass the tests set up by freecodecamp. 

I researched a topic for my survey and came up with "finding out which European ironman is best suited for you". The idea behind this survey is to help me decide which one I'll attempt within the next two years. 

I started building a json file to list all the ironmans. 

**Thoughts:** The hardest was to find the idea behind my survey and to shape the questions for the survey. 

**Duration:** 1h42

### R1D1: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

I'm building the Started a Weather App. Worked on the draft layout of the app, struggled with OpenWeather API http://www.example.com

### R1D2

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

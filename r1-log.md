# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Alex Disdier

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [September 29, Saturday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1: September 29, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the skeleton of my tribute page project from the freeCodeCamp Curriculum. I passed all the test. I then started to style my page. 

**Thoughts:** The hardest was to find the person I should write about. Then I had to come up with a design. I chose to follow medium style. 

**Duration:** 1h48

**Links to work:** 
1. Project on codepen - [Tribute page](https://codepen.io/alexdisdier/pen/XxWpZR)
2. Project on github - [Tribute page](https://alexdisdier.github.io/tribute/)

### R1D2: September 30, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I realized I forgot to add [meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag), which is crucial for responsive design. 

I added some some media queries and work on my css. 
I included some share buttons. 
The page is pretty much finished. I'm going to ask some feedbacks to friends, polish and move on to next project. 

**Thoughts:** It is hard to keep it around an hour. It doesn't feel sufficient time to make significant progress. Nevertheless, it pushes you to stay efficient, which is something I need to work on. 

**Duration:** 2h23

### R1D1: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
